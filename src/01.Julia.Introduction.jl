#md # # Why Julia?
#md #
#md # - Born in 2009 and version 1.0 was released in August 2018.
#md # - High-level languages like Python and R let one explore and experiment rapidly, but can run slow.
#md # - Low-level languages like Fortran/C++ tend to take longer to develop, but run fast.
#md # - This is sometimes called the "two language problem" and is something the Julia developers set out to eliminate. 
#md # - Julia's promise is to provide a "best of both worlds" experience for programmers who need to develop novel algorithms and bring them into production environments with minimal effort.

#md # # Julia's Engineering and Design Tradoffs
#md #
#md # - Type structures cannot bechanges after created (less dynamism but memory layout can be optimized for)
#md # - All functions are JIT compiled via LLVM (interactive lags but massive runtime improvements)
#md # - All functions specialize on types of arguments (more compilation but give generic programming structures)
#md # - Julia is interactive (use it like Python and R, but makes it harder to get binaries)
#md # - Julia has great methods for handling mutation (more optimization opportunities like C/Fortran, but more cognative burden)
#md # - Julia's Base library and most packages are written in Julia, (you can understand the source, but learn a new package)
#md # - Julia has expensive tooling for code generation and metaprogramming (consise and more optimizations, but some codes can be for experienced users)
#md #
#md # To me, this gives me a language with a lot of depth which works well for computationally-expensive scientific applications.

#md # # Type-Dispatch Programming
#md #
#md # - Centered around implementing the generic template of the algorithm not around building representations of data.
#md # - The data type choose how to efficiently implement the algorithm.
#md # - With this feature share and reuse code is very easy
