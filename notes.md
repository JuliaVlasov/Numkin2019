Introduction

High-level languages like Python and R let one explore and experiment rapidly, but can run slow.

Low-level languages like Fortran/C++ tend to take longer to develop, but run fast.

This is sometimes called the "two language problem" and is something the Julia developers set out to eliminate. 

When you mix two langages you have to use building tools like Makefiles, you can 
have bootlenecks because you need to convert types from one language to the other.
You could need more memory, have protability issues and it is harder to share your work.

- Julia's promise is to provide a "best of both worlds" experience for 
programmers who need to develop novel algorithms and bring them into 
production environments with minimal effort.
