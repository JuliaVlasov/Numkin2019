### Optimizing Julia code is often done at the expense of transparency


```julia
using Random, LinearAlgebra, BenchmarkTools

function test(A, B, C)
    C = C - A * B
    return C
end

A = rand(1024, 256); B = rand(256, 1024); C = rand(1024, 1024)
@btime test(A, B, C); #C, A and B are matrices.
```


```
  5.288 ms (4 allocations: 16.00 MiB)
```


--


```julia
function test_opt(A, B, C)
    BLAS.gemm!('N','N', -1., A, B, 1., C)
    return C
end
@btime test_opt(A, B, C) # avoids taking two unnecessary copies of the matrix C.
```


```
  2.421 ms (0 allocations: 0 bytes)
```

```julia
C = rand(1024, 1024)
all(test(A, B, C) .== test_opt(A, B, C))
```


```
true
```

### Derivative computation with FFT


```julia
using FFTW

xmin, xmax, nx = 0, 4π, 1024
ymin, ymax, ny = 0, 4π, 1024

x = range(xmin, stop=xmax, length=nx+1)[1:end-1]
y = range(ymin, stop=ymax, length=ny+1)[1:end-1]

ky  = 2π ./ (ymax-ymin) .* [0:ny÷2-1;ny÷2-ny:-1]
exky = exp.( 1im .* ky' .* x)

function df_dy( f, exky )
    ifft(exky .* fft(f, 2), 2)
end

f = sin.(x) .* cos.(y') # f is a 2d array created by broadcasting

@btime df_dy(f, exky)
```


```
  109.302 ms (127 allocations: 64.01 MiB)
```

### Memory alignement, and inplace computation.


```julia
f  = zeros(ComplexF64, (nx,ny))
fᵗ = zeros(ComplexF64, reverse(size(f)))
f̂ᵗ = zeros(ComplexF64, reverse(size(f)))

f .= sin.(x) .* cos.(y')

fft_plan = plan_fft(fᵗ, 1, flags=FFTW.PATIENT)

function df_dy!( f, fᵗ, f̂ᵗ, exky )
    transpose!(fᵗ,f)
    mul!(f̂ᵗ,  fft_plan, fᵗ)
    f̂ᵗ .= f̂ᵗ .* exky
    ldiv!(fᵗ, fft_plan, f̂ᵗ)
    transpose!(f, fᵗ)
end

@btime df_dy!(f, fᵗ, f̂ᵗ, exky )
```


```
  36.612 ms (3 allocations: 176 bytes)

# Why use Julia language!


  * **You develop in the same language in which you optimize.**
  * Packaging system is very efficient (3173 registered packages)
  * PyPi (198,360 projects) R (14993 packages)
  * It is very easy to create a package (easier than R and Python)
  * It is very easy to use GPU device.
  * Nice interface for Linear Algebra and Differential Equations
  * Easy access to BLAS and LAPACK
  * Julia talks to all major Languages - mostly without overhead!

# What's bad


  * It is still hard to build shared library or executable from Julia code.
  * Compilation times can be unbearable.
  * Plotting takes time (20 seconds for the first plot)
  * OpenMP is better than the Julia multithreading library but it is progressing.
  * There is a MPI and PETSc package but they are not very active.
  * For parallelization, The Julia community seems to prefer the ditributed processing approach.
  * Does not work well with vectorized code, you need to do a lot of inplace computation to avoid memory allocations and use explicit views to avoid copy.
  * Julia website proclaims that it is faster than Fortran but this is not true.

## So when should i use Julia?


  * Now! If you need performance and plan to write your own libraries.
  * In ~1-2 Years if you want a smooth deploy.
  * In ~3-5 Years if you want a 100% smooth experience.
