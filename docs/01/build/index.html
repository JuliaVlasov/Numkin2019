# Who am I ?


  * My name is *Pierre Navaro*
  * **Fortran 77 + PVM** : during my PhD 1998-2002 (Université du Havre)
  * **Fortran 90-2003 + OpenMP-MPI** : Engineer in Strasbourg (2003-2015) at IRMA
  * **Numpy + Cython, R + Rcpp** : Engineer in Rennes (2015-now) at IRMAR
  * **Julia v1.0** since July 2018

# Why Julia?


  * Born in 2009 and version 1.0 was released in August 2018.
  * High-level languages like Python and R let one explore and experiment rapidly, but can run slow.
  * Low-level languages like Fortran/C++ tend to take longer to develop, but run fast.
  * This is sometimes called the "two language problem" and is something the Julia developers set out to eliminate.
  * Julia's promise is to provide a "best of both worlds" experience for programmers who need to develop novel algorithms and bring them into production environments with minimal effort.

# Julia's Engineering and Design Tradoffs


  * Type structures cannot bechanges after created (less dynamism but memory layout can be optimized for)
  * All functions are JIT compiled via LLVM (interactive lags but massive runtime improvements)
  * All functions specialize on types of arguments (more compilation but give generic programming structures)
  * Julia is interactive (use it like Python and R, but makes it harder to get binaries)
  * Julia has great methods for handling mutation (more optimization opportunities like C/Fortran, but more cognative burden)
  * Julia's Base library and most packages are written in Julia, (you can understand the source, but learn a new package)
  * Julia has expensive tooling for code generation and metaprogramming (consise and more optimizations, but some codes can be for experienced users)


To me, this gives me a language with a lot of depth which works well for computationally-expensive scientific applications.

# Type-Dispatch Programming


  * Centered around implementing the generic template of the algorithm not around building representations of data.
  * The data type choose how to efficiently implement the algorithm.
  * With this feature share and reuse code is very easy

```julia
using DifferentialEquations, Plots

g = 9.79 # Gravitational constants
L = 1.00 # Length of the pendulum

#Initial Conditions
u₀ = [0, π / 60] # Initial speed and initial angle
tspan = (0.0, 6.3) # time domain

#Define the problem
function simplependulum(du, u, p, t)
    θ = u[1]
    dθ = u[2]
    du[1] = dθ
    du[2] = -(g/L)*θ
end

#Pass to solvers
prob = ODEProblem(simplependulum, u₀, tspan)
sol = solve(prob, Tsit5(), reltol = 1e-6)
```


---


Analytic solution


```julia
u = u₀[2] .* cos.(sqrt(g / L) .* sol.t)

plot(sol.t, getindex.(sol.u, 2), label = "Numerical")
scatter!(sol.t, u, label = "Analytic")
```
